# REST API

The Relevance Studio [server](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/architecture.md#server) provides a REST API to manage workspace assets in the studio deployment, search data in the content deployment, and run evaluations in the content deployment.

All REST API endpoints accept payloads as JSON and return payloads as JSON (`application/json`).
