/**
 * Monaco Editor uses Web Workers to power language features like code folding,
 * syntax validation, and auto-completion. By default, it tries to load these
 * worker scripts from a CDN or expects a bundler (like Webpack with a Monaco
 * plugin) to handle them automatically.
 *
 * Since we're self-hosting Monaco and copying the raw `monaco-editor/min` files
 * into our `dist/` directory, Monaco doesn't know where to find its workers.
 * Without this `MonacoEnvironment.getWorkerUrl` override, Monaco fails to load
 * the necessary workers — which silently disables folding and other features.
 *
 * This block tells Monaco where to find the worker scripts locally.
 * It's required whenever Monaco is used without a bundler plugin that
 * automatically wires up the workers (e.g. `monaco-editor-webpack-plugin`).
 * 
 * However, it doesn't seem to be working completely. Code folding doesn't work
 * with this code block uncommented, which is symptomatic that it's not working
 * as expected. So I'm leaving it commeted out for now.
